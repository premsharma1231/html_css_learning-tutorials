Hi there, my name is Purvish Sharma. I am a BCA (Computer Science) student, and I would like to take this opportunity to inform you that I began learning web development in 2023. The tutorials I have uploaded are from earlier in the process; I apologize for my lack of discipline at the time, but I was unaware of github, linkedin, and indeed.
I've developed a few little projects in these tutorials, and each one has a distinct HTML and CSS functionality with a different component.
I've worked on a lot of projects, so I sincerely hope you enjoy this one. Please continue to communicate.
