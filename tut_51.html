        // Here we don't have to justify the types of variable it will automatically justify by the value you gave to it 
        var a=5;  //here we are making a variable by giving a = 5 by giving integer value
        var b = 'Prem'; // Here i gave the value string as character value in variable b
        var c=65.22; //Here i am giving the integer float value to variable c

        // Operators in Javascript
        // Operand = Entities on which the operators operate.
        // Let me explain you about the operators , example 3 + 5 then here the sign of plus '+' is an operator and the 3 and 5 is an operand .
        // 1 . Unary Operator - Here it has or contains only single operands , eg., (-5) or (*4)
        // Here this is the example of unary operator as making the value of c to negative c=(-c)
        c = (-c);
        console.log(c);
        // 2 . Binary Operator - Here it has or it contains two operands , eg., (5 + 7) so its containing 5 + 7 means containing two operands follows the example
        c = 54+45;
        console.log(c);

        // Lets understand about arithmetic operator 
        // Arithmetic operator contains the mathematic operators like addition , substraction , division , multiplication .
        var a=55;
        var b=66;
        console.log("The addition of 55 + 66 = "+ (a + b));
        console.log("The Substraction of 55 - 66 = "+ (a - b));
        console.log("The Multiplication of 55 * 66 = "+ (a * b));
        console.log("The Division of 55 / 66 = "+ (a / b));

        // I should also explain you about Increment and Decrement operator
        // There are two types of increment and same as two types of decrement as pre and post increment and same as pre and post decrement
        var d=5;
        console.log("The post-increment is suppose to look like "+ (d++)); //As in post increment it suppose to increase the value after printing the current value
        console.log("The pre-increment is suppose to look like "+ (++d)); //As in pre-increment the value is suppose to increase before printing the current value , so to print the increase value , and the same procedure is for decrement
        console.log("The pre-decrement is suppose to look like "+ (--d));
        console.log("The post-decrement is suppose to look like "+ (d--));
        console.log(d); // As after the post decrement it printed the value 5

        // Let me tell you about exponential operator , where it suppose to perform sqares , cubes or any power of the integer , following example
        var e=3;
        var f=6;
        console.log("The Exponential operator as e**f means 3 is to power 6 is = "+(e**f));
