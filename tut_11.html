<!-- Welcome to this tutorial -->   
<!-- In this weblearning in am going to tell you about HTML entities and i want to tell you that if we want to give spaces in any title of code contains sentences , forms , paragraph , and etc
So to give the spaces the &nbsp = non breaking space -->
<!-- So whenever you want to print the tags like <p> <em> <strong> <u> so if you want to print like this words so you have to write code in this way &lt;p&gt; so if you write the code in this way you will print the <p> tag -->
    <!-- So this is known as HTML entities -->
    <!-- So if you want to write pound and dollar and any symbol so you have to wrtie the tag in the way as for pound (Â£) &pound; for Dollar ($) so you have to write            &dollar; -->
