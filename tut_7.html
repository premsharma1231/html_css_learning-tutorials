<!-- So in tutorial 7, we are going to learn about how to make or create list and table in HTML web development -->
<!-- lets see about how to make lists first -->
<!-- There are two types of lists are as follow -->
<!-- <ul> list </ul> Here ul = unordered list , there is a sub code for ul is <li> list </li> , There are three symbols in unordered lists are i)circle , ii)square iii)disk-->
<!-- <ol> list </ol> Here ol = ordered list , there is also a sub attribute use in ol is <li> list </li> , There are different symbols in ordered list are as follow (i , 1 , I , a , A) , this are the types of symbols in ordered list -->
<!-- You can even modify the list in different texts and font sizes with using CSS , bold and italic -->
<!-- Now lets learn about how to make Tables -->
<!-- There is a tag to start the table is <table> </table> -->
<!-- The <table></table> tag is used where the table starts , in HTML5 where there are two more tags in table are as follows firsat one is thead and seacond one is tbody -->
    <!-- <table>
            <thead>
                <tr>
                    <th> Table writing </th>               
                </tr>
            </thead>
            <tbody>
                <tr>
                    <td> Table Writing </td> 
                </tr>
            </tbody>
        </tsble>
    So here i want to tell you that , we can style the table in different style by using HTML even and even by using the CSS language 
So here is showed that how to write the code for the table in HTML language -->
<!DOCTYPE html>
<html lang="en">
<head>
    <meta charset="UTF-8">
    <meta name="viewport" content="width=device-width, initial-scale=1.0">
    <title>Tables and Lists</title>
    <style>
        .table{
            display: flex;
            flex-direction: column;
            justify-content: center; 
            align-items: center;
        }
    </style>
</head>
<body>
    <!-- Lists -->
    <h1>Lists</h1>
    <h3><ul type="circle"> <!--Here ul = unordered list-->
        <li>This is my first unordered list</li>
        <h5><ol type="i">
            <li>This is my first ordered list</li> <!-- li = list -->
            <li>This is my seacond ordered list</li>
            <li>This is my third ordered list</li></h5>
        </ol>    <!-- ol = Ordered lists-->
        <li>This is my seacond unordered list</li>
        <li>This is my third unordered list</li>
    </ul>
    <h3><ol type="i">
        <li>This is my first ordered list</li>
        <li>This is my seacond ordered list</li>
        <li>This is my third ordered list</li>
    </ol> 
     <!-- Tables -->
     <h1><table class="table"> <!-- Table is an opening tag to write tables and rows-->
     <thead> <!-- thead = Table heading -->
        <tr> <!-- tr = table row -->
            <th>Name</th>     <!-- th means attributes under table heading -->
            <th>Employee ID</th> 
            <th>Work</th>
            <th>Age</th>
        </tr>
     </thead>   <!-- this is an closing tag for table head as </thead> -->
     <tbody>    <!-- This is the opening tag for tbody as table body-->
        <tr>
